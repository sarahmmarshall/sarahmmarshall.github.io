      <h2 class="section-title">Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        During my Computer Science degree, I learned languages like C++, Java, and Python. I worked with tools such as GitHub, Jupyter, Eclipse, OpenGL, and more. My coursework and projects taught me how to work in Agile teams, use Git, interact with stakeholders, and implement data structures, algorithms, and security practices. I also built a full-stack applications using the MEAN stack and developed skills in database design, testing, and REST APIs.
      </p>
      <p>Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-First Search and Sorting Algorithms. 
I created a travel website that allowed users to view trips on the multi-page application, and book trips on the single page application.</p>
        <p>
          This ePortfolio portrays some of my strengths shown in three projects. One project being expanding a projects complexity shown in project one where I created more advanced OpenGL objects and added textures onto them to make the 3D scene more realistic. 
    Another project being expanding the complexity of using data structures and algorithms shown in project two where I replaced an array list data structure with a hash map data structure, which has a better runtime and is overall more efficient. 
    Another project being creating a database using MongoDB Compass and inputting data into it, to then be used in a Python CRUD file and tested the data with a testing file in JupyterNotebook. This was shown in project three where I replaced the existing database with my own database which I added my own data into and tested the connection and CRUD functionality.

        <p><strong>Course:</strong> CS330 - Computer Graphics and Visualization</p>

        <p>
          Rendered 3D objects in C++ and OpenGL. Enhanced scene with new meshes, textures, and lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            This program consists of many classes that all work together to render 3D objects, apply textures to meshes, apply light sources to the scene, and move around the scene with a camera using keys and the mouse. 
            The specific components in the project that showcase my skills and abilities in software development is the addition of more meshes(objects) in the 3D scene and rendering them with textures, enhancing the textures on past objects to make the scene look more realistic, and enhancing the lighting of the scene. The enhancements improved the project as it made it more advanced with better textures, more objects, and better lighting. The enhancements made the 3D scene more realistic.

        <h3>ContactService.java – Project Two</h3>
        <p><strong>Course:</strong> CS320 - Software Test, Automation & QA</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sarahmmarshall/sarahmmarshall.github.io/blob/38abffd603712581463e3ff8d6cb3944fbf4dd4f/ContactService.zip">Original</a> |

        <p>
          Improved performance by replacing an ArrayList with a HashMap for managing contacts in Java. Verified efficiency with JUnit.
        </p>
        <p>
        The purpose of this code is to store contacts using a data structure and to be able to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts in the java programming language. This program consists of four classes, the two classes Contact.java and ContactService.java work together to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts. The other two classes ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java are test classes to run JUnit tests to verify the other two classes work as intended. 
        The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures is the replacement of a data structure with a better suited one. The enhancements improved the project as it made it more advanced with a better data structure. We can see in the JUnit test that the program preformed quicker with a HashMap than with an array list data structure.

        <p>
          Built and tested a CRUD-enabled MongoDB database with Python. Used Jupyter Notebook for validation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The purpose of this code is to make a connection to MongoDB in a python file that has CRUD implementation in it in the python programming language. CRUD refers to the ability to create, update, read and delete data that is found within the database. To test the CRUD functionality that is in the python file, there is an ipynb file to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. 
        I created my own database, added data into it, made a connection within the existing animal_shelter.py file and test the data in Testing_to_database.ipynb file.
        The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in databases is the replacement of my own database and making a connection to it. The enhancements improved the project as I created the database, therefore I know what data is in it and I know the security of it.

    <h2 class="section-title">Full-Stack Travel Website</h2>
    <p>
      I built a travel website using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). It features both a multipage public interface and a secure single-page admin interface for managing trips. To create this website I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and Handlebars.
