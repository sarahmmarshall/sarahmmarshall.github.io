    <p> Throughout the past 2.5 years at SNHU studying for my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I have learned many things. I have learned different programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. I have had hands on experience working with GitHub, Artificial Intelligence, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Eclipse, OpenGL, Algorithms, Data structures, Databases, Full stack applications, MEAN stack, macOS, Windows, Class and Sequence diagrams, Wireframes, Agile, SDLC and much more. This ePortfolio portrays some of my strengths shown in three artifacts. 
        One being expanding a projects complexity shown in artifact one where I created more advanced OpenGL objects and added textures onto them to make the 3D scene more realistic. The before and after screenshots portray how I have advanced since I last completed this specific programming project. 
        Another being expanding the complexity of using data structures and algorithms shown in artifact two where I replaced an array list data structure with a hash map data structure, which has a better runtime and overall more efficient. The before and after screenshots portray how I have advanced since I last completed this specific programming project, as well as show how the code preforms a JUnit test quicker with the hash map data structure.
        Another being creating a MongoDB and inputting data into it, to then be used in a Python CRUD file and tested with a testing file. This was shown in artifact three where I replaced the existing database with my own database which I added my own data into and tested the connection and CRUD functionality. The screenshot portrays how I have advanced since I last completed this specific programming project, as well as show how the testing file was able to perform CRUD functionality from data found in a database I created. 
        Once completion of my degree and I obtain my bachelor’s in computer science, I seek to work within the computer science field. My career goals include working as a Full Stack Developer, Front End Developer, Software Developer, Programmer, Information Technology, Web Developer, UX and/or UI Designer, Data Analyst, as well as having an open mindset for other careers within this field. I am seeking full-time positions either remote, hybrid, or on-site, as well as internships. I am motivated and eager to begin working with what I have been learning over the past few years. 
        Overall, the B.S. computer science program has taught me a broad range of the computer science field. I have gained valuable skills, learned what I am best at doing, as well as areas I need improvement or need more hands on experience with. This program has prepared to enter the computer science field by giving me years of hands on experience within common careers as well as expand my expertise. It has taught me skills outside of computer science as well such as organization, time management, problem solving, critical thinking, communication, independence, teamwork, adaptability, and more. 
        At SNHU, I have learned how to collaborate in a team environment. This was done by using Bitbucket and Git within Eclipse, here I had to open a repository from Bitbucket on Eclipse, create my own branch, work off the code base to add my own files, modify current ones to fit the assignments each week, and commit and push my work to the repository in Bitbucket to be code reviewed by peers. I have learned how to communicate with stakeholders. This was done by working within a Scrum-Agile team and understand needs and expectations from the stakeholders, and communicate in non-technical ways.  I have learned data structures and algorithms. Some data structures are hash maps, arrays, linked lists, binary search tree, and hash tables. Some algorithms I have learned are Reinforcement learning algorithms, Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-First Search and Sorting algorithms. I have learned software engineering and database outside of these artifacts by building a full stack application. The website I created focused on front-end and back-end of an application using the MEAN stack and REST. MEAN is made up of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. REST uses APIs to communicate between systems. I created a travel website that allowed users to view trips on the multi-page application, and book trips on the single page application. I have learned security by including input validation, vulnerability testing, encryption, keeping software up to date, and using proper naming convections within coding programs. 
        The three artifacts fit together and inform the ePortfolio as a whole by showcasing my skills and strengths. The artifacts help show how I have progressed since the last time I worked with the artifact compared to what I was able to accomplish after learning more from the computer science program.

        <p> This artifact is SceneManager.cpp, which comes from CS330. The purpose of this code is to render 3D objects in a scene. This artifact was originally created in October of 2024. This program is coded in the C++ language. This program consists of many classes that all work together to render 3D objects, apply textures to meshes, apply light sources to the scene, and move around the scene with a camera using keys and the mouse. 
            I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it was one of the more complex projects I have worked on during my time at SNHU that is in the software design and engineering category. The specific components in the artifacts that showcase my skills and abilities in software development is the addition of more meshes(objects) in the 3D scene and rendering them with textures, enhancing the textures on past objects to make the scene look more realistic, and enhancing the lighting of the scene. The enhancements improved the artifact as it made it more advanced with better textures, more objects, and better lighting. The enhancements made the 3D scene more realistic. Some specific skills I demonstrated in my enhancement was making the scene more realistic and mastering rendering of 3D objects using OpenGL by creating advanced objects. 
            Some things I learned while creating and enhancing the artifact was troubleshooting. Opening a .sln solution from a previous class that was completed on a Virtual Machine made it hard to get it running again, there were many bugs in the code that had to be resolved by rewiring some paths as well as importing libraries. After spending the past three weeks trying to get this program running from my zipped final project in CS330, I decided to try to replace the OpenGL sample SceneManager.cpp that was given as a starting point in CS330, with my SceneManager.cpp that I created in the final project of that class. This resolved the issues, and I was finally able to work on my .cpp file. The artifact was improved by creating a background with a realistic texture of brick on it, creating a cup with a realistic texture of ice on it and fixing the light sources. The course outcomes that I met with these enhancements are design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry- specific goals. All of the other outcomes were not met in this artifact as they did not relate with this project. There was not any feedback to incorporate as I made changes to the artifact.

        <p> This artifact is ContactService.java, which comes from CS320. The purpose of this code is to store contacts using a data structure and to be able to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts. This artifact was originally created in January of 2024. This program is coded in the java language. This program consists of four classes, the two classes Contact.java and ContactService.java work together to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts. The other two classes ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java are test classes to run JUnit tests to verify the other two classes work as intended. 
I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it was a perfect example of a program using a data structure. I noticed it was currently using an array list, and I knew that I could enhance the code by replacing it with a HashMap data structure. HashMap data structures have a better runtime than array lists and they also are better for larger amounts of data. Considering the data structure is used to store contacts, we are unsure how many contacts would be stored. I believe it is best to assume a large number of contacts would be stored. This results in a HashMap data structure being a better fit for this program to store contacts. 
 The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures is the replacement of a data structure with a better suited one. The enhancements improved the artifact as it made it more advanced with a better data structure. We can see in the JUnit test that the program preformed quicker with a HashMap than with an array list. The enhancement made the program run quicker. Some specific skills I demonstrated in my enhancement was mastering data structures within a code by replacing the data structure that is used to a more efficient one, making the artifact perform better and debugging the code while doing so. 
Some things I learned while creating and enhancing the artifact was troubleshooting. Opening a previous program from a previous class that was completed on a Virtual Machine made it hard to get it running again. The major thing was JUnit not being configured in my Eclipse. After spending time trying to get JUnit tests configured I was able to run it and test the original code. While making the change from an array list to HashMap, the code had errors in both the ContactService.java and ContactServiceTest.java. These errors weren’t difficult to debug by taking it one issue at a time. I learned how HashMaps are easier to get access to the data inside of it than array lists. The artifact was improved by replacing the existing data structure with a better one for this program. The course outcomes that I met with these enhancements are employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry- specific goals. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. All of the other outcomes were not met in this artifact as they did not relate with this project.  There was not any feedback to incorporate as I made changes to the artifact.

            This artifact is animal_shelter.py, which comes from CS340. The purpose of this code is to make a connection to MongoDB in a python file that has CRUD implementation in it. CRUD refers to the ability to create, update, read and delete data that is found within the database. This artifact was originally created in May of 2024. This program is coded in the python language. To test the CRUD functionality that is in the python file, there is an ipynb file to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. 
I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it was a perfect example of a code fetching data from a database. I wanted to create my own database, add data into it, and make a connection within the existing animal_shelter.py file and test it in Testing_to_database.ipynb file.
 The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in databases  is the replacement of my own database and making a connection to it. The enhancements improved the artifact as the database is my own. Some specific skills I demonstrated in my enhancement was mastering the creation of a database, adding data to it, implement CRUD in. a.py file, and test it in an ipynb file. Some things I learned while creating and enhancing the artifact was troubleshooting. Opening a previous program from a previous class that was completed on a Virtual Machine made it hard to get it running again. The major thing was the connection to the database. After spending time trying to get connection to a database, I was able to make a connection to my own database with my own data in it, and test the CRUD functionality. The artifact was improved by replacing the existing database with my own. The course outcomes that I met with these enhancements employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.
