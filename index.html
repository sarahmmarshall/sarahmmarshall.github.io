      <h2 class="section-title">Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        During my Computer Science degree, I learned languages like C++, Java, and Python. I worked with tools such as GitHub, Jupyter, Eclipse, OpenGL, and more. My coursework and projects taught me how to work in Agile teams, use Git, interact with stakeholders, and implement data structures, algorithms, and security practices. I also built a full-stack applications using the MEAN stack and developed skills in database design, testing, and REST APIs.
      </p>
      <p>While studying for my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, I have learned different programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. I have had hands on experience working with GitHub, Artificial Intelligence, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Eclipse, OpenGL, Algorithms, Data Structures, Databases, Full Stack Applications, MEAN Stack, MacOS, Windows, Class and Sequence Diagrams, Wireframes, Agile, SDLC and much more.  
        I have learned how to collaborate in a team environment. This was done by using Bitbucket and Git within Eclipse, here I had to open a repository from Bitbucket on Eclipse, create my own branch, work off the code base to add my own files, modify current ones to fit the assignments each week, and commit and push my work to the repository in Bitbucket to be code reviewed by peers. I have learned how to communicate with stakeholders. 
        This was done by working within a Scrum-Agile team and understand needs and expectations from the stakeholders, and communicate in non-technical ways.  I have learned data structures and algorithms. Some data structures are hash maps, arrays, linked lists, binary search tree, and hash tables. Some algorithms I have learned are Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-First Search and Sorting Algorithms. 
        I have learned security by including input validation, vulnerability testing, encryption, keeping software up to date, and using proper naming convections within coding programs. 
        I have learned software engineering and databases by building a full stack application. The website I created focused on front-end and back-end of an application using the MEAN Stack and REST. 
        MEAN is made up of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. REST uses APIs to communicate between systems. I created a travel website that allowed users to view trips on the multi-page application, and book trips on the single page application.</p>
        <p>
          This ePortfolio portrays some of my strengths shown in three projects. One project being expanding a projects complexity shown in project one where I created more advanced OpenGL objects and added textures onto them to make the 3D scene more realistic. 
    Another project being expanding the complexity of using data structures and algorithms shown in project two where I replaced an array list data structure with a hash map data structure, which has a better runtime and is overall more efficient. 
    Another project being creating a database using MongoDB Compass and inputting data into it, to then be used in a Python CRUD file and tested the data with a testing file in JupyterNotebook. This was shown in project three where I replaced the existing database with my own database which I added my own data into and tested the connection and CRUD functionality.

          Rendered 3D objects in C++ and OpenGL. Enhanced scene with new meshes, textures, and lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is SceneManager.cpp, which comes from CS330 - Computer Graphic and Visualization. The purpose of this code is to render 3D objects in a scene in the C++ programming language and OpenGL. This program consists of many classes that all work together to render 3D objects, apply textures to meshes, apply light sources to the scene, and move around the scene with a camera using keys and the mouse. 
            The specific components in the project that showcase my skills and abilities in software development is the addition of more meshes(objects) in the 3D scene and rendering them with textures, enhancing the textures on past objects to make the scene look more realistic, and enhancing the lighting of the scene. The enhancements improved the project as it made it more advanced with better textures, more objects, and better lighting. The enhancements made the 3D scene more realistic.

        <p>
          Improved performance by replacing an ArrayList with a HashMap for managing contacts in Java. Verified efficiency with JUnit.
        </p>
        <p>
        This project is ContactService.java, which comes from CS320 - Software Test, Automation & QA. The purpose of this code is to store contacts using a data structure and to be able to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts in the java programming language. This program consists of four classes, the two classes Contact.java and ContactService.java work together to add, delete, retrieve, and update contacts. The other two classes ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java are test classes to run JUnit tests to verify the other two classes work as intended. 
        The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures is the replacement of a data structure with a better suited one. The enhancements improved the project as it made it more advanced with a better data structure. We can see in the JUnit test that the program preformed quicker with a HashMap than with an array list data structure.

          Built and tested a CRUD-enabled MongoDB database with Python. Used Jupyter for validation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is animal_shelter.py, which comes from CS340 - Client/Server Development. The purpose of this code is to make a connection to MongoDB in a python file that has CRUD implementation in it. CRUD refers to the ability to create, update, read and delete data that is found within the database. This program is coded in the python language. To test the CRUD functionality that is in the python file, there is an ipynb file to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. 
 I created my own database, added data into it, made a connection within the existing animal_shelter.py file and test the data in Testing_to_database.ipynb file.
 The specific components in the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in databases is the replacement of my own database and making a connection to it. The enhancements improved the project as I created the database, therefore I know what data is in it and I know the security of it.

    <h2 class="section-title">Full-Stack Travel Website</h2>
    <p>
      I built a travel website using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). It features both a multipage public interface and a secure single-page admin interface for managing trips.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following screenshots, I showcase a full stack website I created using the MEAN stack. This includes Mongodb, Express, Angular, and Node. To create this website I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and Handlebars.
